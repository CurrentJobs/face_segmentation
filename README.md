# Face segmentation with CNN and CRF

We try different methods to complete face segmentation:
- [A CNN Cascade for Landmark Guided Semantic Part Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.09642.pdf). Models and more details please refer to Aaron Jackson's [website](https://aaronsplace.co.uk/). We add CRF as postprocessing. CRF is implemented by [pydensecrf](https://github.com/lucasb-eyer/pydensecrf).
- [On Face Segmentation, Face Swapping, and Face Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06729), original [codes](https://github.com/YuvalNirkin/face_segmentation).
- Landmarks detection and convex hull generation.
