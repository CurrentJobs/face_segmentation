**DO NOT USE THIS BRANCH---IT IS DEPRECATED**

See the [fcn.berkeleyvision.org repo](https://github.com/shelhamer/fcn.berkeleyvision.org) for details, reference models, and code.

This was a pre-release Caffe branch for fully convolutional networks (FCNs); however, the needed FCN features are now included in the Caffe master branch.
Note however there are differences in the master edition, so refer to the documentation there.

This includes unmerged PRs and no guarantees.
Everything here is subject to change, including the history of this branch.
Consider PR #2016 for reducing memory usage.

See `future.sh` for details.
